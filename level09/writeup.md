#SnowCrash Level09

As before a binary and a token.
This time we can see what's on the token.


Note: There's more than 2 ways to find the solution for this challenge.
I used the dumb one.

I gave the binary the following string :
```
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 0000000000
0123456789
```

I mean even a baby can see the difference.
```
str[i] = str[i] + index.
```

I made a script using C to do this. You will find it within this folder.

I got the string using hexdump. And then added a "0x" at the beginning for C.

The output is : f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq

```
level09@SnowCrash:~$ su flag09
Password:
Don't forget to launch getflag !
flag09@SnowCrash:~$ getflag
Check flag.Here is your token :
