# SnowCrash

Hello, This is SnowCrash project in 42. The starter projects for cyber security branch.

<h2>What are you going to learn in this project ?</h2>
<h4>Basic Linux Enumeration</h4>
This is one of the most important part if you are thinking about getting into penetration testing. You have to know exactly where to look and what to look for.
In the early levels of SnowCrash you will be doing that. Not much levels require enumeration, but for a starter is good. And don't stop by this project try to read articles about how and what to enumerate.
<h4>Binaries</h5>
Other than Linux enumeration, the last levels of this projects requires you to reverse binaries and understand the disassembly(better without using the decompiler).
Using only gdb I was able to reverse those binaries and solve each challenge by disassembling the main.
I'd recommend to watch the following playlist, you don't to watch all of it tho. It will be supper useful to finish those levels.

<h4>Scripting</h4>
Scripting is an important part in cyber security, wether bash scripting or python scripting you should give it a try. There are couple of levels in this project that will require you to write a script or 2. Try doing them in different ways.
<h4>SimpleHTTPRequests</h4>
Some levels will give you the ability to send simple http request with some variables. It is good for beginners but again try not to stop there. Try to read more about this part of the project.
